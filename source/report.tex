	In one dimension, the Gaussian function is the probability density function of the normal distribution. 
	
	\begin{equation}
		f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{\dfrac{-(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
	\end{equation}
	
	sometimes also called the frequency curve. The full width at half maximum for a Gaussian is found by finding the half-maximum points $x_0$.
	
	\subsection{Project Definition}
	Project definition. Describe your project in this section. Provide the project scope, functional and non-functional requirements of the project. 
	
	\subsection{Project Planning}
	Apply Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to determine tasks and subtasks. Provide a GANTT chart with a time table, identify responsible person(s) for each task.

	\newpage
	\subsubsection{Aim of the project}
	Describe the aim of the project in one paragraph.
	
	\subsubsection{Project definition}
	Describe the content of the project. 
	
	\subsubsection{Use Cases}
	Provide UML use case diagrams by specifying systems, actors, use cases and relationships. \cite{kahneman2011thinking}
	
	\subsubsection{Success Criteria}
	Describe the success criteria of the project. 
	
	\subsubsection{Project time and resource estimation}
	Provide time (Month) and effort (Person/Month) estimation of the project. Describe how you estimated them. Provide a cost estimate of the project by considering the human resources, hardware and software resources etc.
	
	\subsubsection{Solution Strategies and Applicable Methods}
	Describe the alternative approaches to solve the problem. After comparing their advantageous and disadvantageous, explain the method you decided to use to solve each sub problem in the project, together with why you selected this method. 
	
	\subsubsection{Risk Analysis}
	Describe what are the risks of completing the project successfully. Identify the risks, their impacts and likelihoods. Describe how to avoid these risks and what to do if the risk occurs. \cite{duan2017question}
	
	\subsubsection{Tools Needed}
	Describe which software and hardware tools you need in the project.
	\cite{rothstein2017color}
	
	
	\section{Theoretical Background}
	You will define your problem in this section and add subheadings as needed. If you give your problem description and solution methodology in this section, you may need to change the title of this section. We usually write a couple of sentence in this part that explains what we will discuss in this section. For example: We will first provide the problem definition of our study (write you topic here), and then give the mathematical model that we propose as a solution method in this section.
	
	\subsection{Literature Survey}
	Provide a survey of the relevant literature. A bibliography (or references) is a selected list of all books, articles, and other source material related to the project and is always in alphabetical order, with the author's last name first. You have to cite a reference within the document as the authors last name (year). For example, “Jones (1969) show that ....”. If the article has only one author, then the citation will be Jones (1969); if the article has two authors, then the citation will be Jones and Brown (1969); for all others, the citation will be Jones et al. (1969). For example; the first reference of this document is cited as Bass (1969), the second one is cited as Bass and Bass (2004), and the third one is cited as DeKimpe et al. (2000). If the citation is in parentheses, then the citations will be (Bass, 1969), (Jones and Brown, 1969) and (Bass et al., 1969) for the above example, respectively.
